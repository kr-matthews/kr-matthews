I'm Kevin Matthews, a **mathematician** by training. Generally, I'm interested in most kinds of **problem solving** related to mathematics and programming.

I have a **Bachelor of Mathematics** from the **University of Waterloo**, where I studied Pure Math, Applied Math, Combinatorics & Optimization, and Computational Math.
I also have a **Master of Arts** from the **University of California, Los Angeles**, where I studied Mathematical Logic.

I work as a **software developer** at [**Ensemble Systems**](https://www.ensemble.com/).
My current work is on an Android project, working in Kotlin, where my main focus is on introducing **Jetpack Compose** to the project and replacing the existing xml-based views.
I also worked as the front-end lead for a previous project in **ReactJS**, making use of Chakra UI, and TanStack Query to interact with the back-end via GraphQL queries.
Before that, I worked as a **software engineer** at [**Rivian**](https://rivian.com/), an electric vehicle company, focusing on **Android app development with Kotlin** - in particular, setup/pairing flows for various devices via Bluetooth low energy, and certain app-wide initiatives to improve reusability and consistency.

In the past, I've created several (useful, but poorly designed/implemented) web apps related to Rubik's cubes.
I'm currently working through various [personal projects](https://kr-matthews.github.io/projects), primarily **React web apps**, with the aim of improving my skills and learning new ones. These include a personal website, a blog, various games (such as minesweeper, connect 4, and cribbage), and an app leveraging the Strava API.

Additionally, I'm a **volunteer member of the World Cube Association** [**software team**](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/teams-committees), where my main focus is on **transitioning our front-end from Ruby on Rails to React**, and on **building out a** [**new registration system**](https://github.com/thewca/wca-registration) in React. I also work on various other improvements and fixes.
