I'm Kevin Matthews, a mathematician by training. Generally, I'm interested in most kinds of problem solving related to mathematics and programming.

I have a Bachelor of Mathematics from the University of Waterloo, where I studied Pure Math, Applied Math, Combinatorics & Optimization, and Computational Math.
I also have a Master of Arts from the University of California, Los Angeles, where I studied Mathematical Logic.

In the past, I've created several (useful, but poorly designed and implemented) web apps related to Rubik's cubes.
I'm currently working on creating various web apps -- personal website, blog, simple games, etc. -- with the aim of improving my skills and learning new ones.
