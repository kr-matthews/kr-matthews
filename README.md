I'm Kevin Matthews, a **mathematician** by training. Generally, I'm interested in most kinds of **problem solving** related to mathematics and programming.

I have a **Bachelor of Mathematics** from the **University of Waterloo**, where I studied Pure Math, Applied Math, Combinatorics & Optimization, and Computational Math.
I also have a **Master of Arts** from the **University of California, Los Angeles**, where I studied Mathematical Logic.

Most recently, I worked as a **software engineer** at [Rivian](https://rivian.com/), an electric vehicle company, focusing on Android app development with Kotlin - in particular, setup/pairing flows for various devices via Bluetooth low energy, and certain app-wide initiatives to improve reusability and consistency.
Before that, I worked in financial technology.

In the past, I've created several (useful, but poorly designed/implemented) web apps related to Rubik's cubes.
I'm currently working through various [personal projects](https://kr-matthews.github.io/projects), mostly either **React web apps** or **Kotlin Android apps**, with the aim of improving my skills and learning new ones. These include a personal website, a blog, various games (such as minesweeper, connect 4, and cribbage), and Rubik's Cube-related tools.

Additionally, I'm a **volunteer member of the World Cube Association** [**software team**](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/teams-committees), where my main focus is on **transitioning our front-end from Ruby on Rails to React**. I also work on various other improvements and fixes.
